Custom Table Views
================

UITableView already comes with a lot of useful features, but what if you need to get REALLY fancy? You might need to put more content in a row than what the basic UITableViewCell allows. Or maybe you need more than just a title in a section header or footer. Nonetheless, creating a custom table view can also give your app a unique look (if you want to break out of the mold) while still adhering to the HIG. In this project, we take advantage of what UITableView offers and then extend it by creating custom headers, footers, and cells with MVC architecture.

I encourge you to check out this project, explore its features, and practice your Custom Table View skills by expanding the project or creating one of your own.
